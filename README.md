# Teensy_USB_Controller
<h3>Originally created for a Teensy++ 2.0</h3>

This program features an Xbox style controller with two joysticks, 17 buttons, and a toggle switch to allow the joystick to act as a mouse. It's based off the Teensy USB Joystick example code as well as Gadget Reboot's USB Mouse code, which can be found at the links below
